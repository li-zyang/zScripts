# Good-For-Reading

Limit the width of old-styled websites (which has it's text content expand across the whole wide window) and add a catalogue sidebar for a comfortable reading. This script does not affect those "modern" web pages (At least I tried to avoid that. If it fails, you can report the bug on github).
